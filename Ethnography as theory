"ethnography is a theory of description"

"Malinowski, in his work with the Pacific Trobriand Islanders, underscored the scientificity of 
ethnography by outlining three methodological tenets of research: statistical documentation, 
attention to the imponderabilia of actual life and observed behavior, 
and the recording of spoken statements indicating the mentality of native thought."

"Although the above-mentioned ethnographers have their adherents, opposition to innovative, eclectic, 
and open-ended loose and strict works have been dismissed by judgments that use words like “journalistic,” 
“political,” “non-analytic,” or “unscientific,” outrage that the ethnographers, by placing themselves, their societies, 
and those that they study all on equal footing, have crossed a line, violated an unspoken consensus. 
It is still easy to denigrate or to mark the boundaries of acceptable ethnography
, even though it has been clear for a good long time now that science is not and cannot be politically neutral. 
In past times, and in the present, people still argue for scientific objectivity
, a concept that often does little else than conceal the scientist’s highly subjective position."
